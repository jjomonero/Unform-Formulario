#Unform
Unform is a performance-focused API for creating powerful forms experiences for both React and React Native. Using hooks, you can build lightweight and composable forms based on ultra-extensible components. Integrate with any form library, validate your fields, and have your data out of the box.

Designed to have zero design
As a form API, Unform was designed to have zero design. Easily integrate with UI libraries or CSS-in-JS solutions to build form components and display errors, change colors, add icons, and use your style guide.

Extensible
Unform exposes hooks to integrate with any form library, such as React Select and React Datepicker. Access form data, errors, refs, and more manually from within your component using the form reference.

#Complex data and relationships
Using Unform nested fields API, you can quickly create complex form structures with no effort, despite the back-end data, keeping form structures reusable and straightforward.

#Yup
Yup is a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation. Define a schema, transform a value to match, validate the shape of an existing value, or both. Yup schema are extremely expressive and allow modeling complex, interdependent validations, or value transformations.

Yup's API is heavily inspired by Joi, but leaner and built with client-side validation as its primary use-case. Yup separates the parsing and validating functions into separate steps. cast() transforms data while validate checks that the input is the correct shape. Each can be performed together (such as HTML form validation) or seperately (such as deserializing trusted data from APIs).
